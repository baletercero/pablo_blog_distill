I'm a Data Scientist at [James Hardie Building Products](https://www.jameshardie.com/) based out of Chicago, IL

For as long as I can remember I have been passionate about data science, statistics and programming.

My interests are all things R/RStudio , Python , machine/deep learning and web development. I enjoy chess and golf.
