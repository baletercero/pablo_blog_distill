### Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a Data Scientist at [James Hardie Building Products](https://www.jameshardie.com/) based out of Chicago, IL. I'm passionate about all things R , Python, machine/deep learning and web development. Of particular interest to me are forecasting techniques and libraries as I have spent a few years of my professional career in demand planning.
